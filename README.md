# full-stack-technical-assessment-front-end
An example back end project written in React Redux

This is the front-end corresponding to the back end:

This was originally an assigment for a coding technical test. The readme there has more details about the original assignment.
To summarize, the goal of this project was to have business items that could be viewed, created, updated, and deleted. And also a function for viewing the highest priced/cost of each item by name and also to show a list of the highest price/cost versions of each item (again, by name) in the data store.

This uses React Redux to view items from a data store on the backend, which is a .NET Core webservice.
This uses react-bootstrap for visuals and axios for HTTP client.

A lot of this front-end app was based on examples found in this tutorial:
